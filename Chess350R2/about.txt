Chess350 is a new chess program, still in beta, that will be so great that it will turn the chess world almost completely around. 
At this moment, it includes a two-player game and a one-player game with three different playing styles.
All normal chess rules are in Chess350, including castling and en passent moves. The current selected piece will have a blue background, 
while the legal moves for the piece will have a green background. Also, the last move will be shown with a yellow background. 
The show legals moves and show last move options can be disabled under game settings.
Chess350 also includes background music and the ability to undo your last movie, along with save and load games.

Have fun playing Chess350!
